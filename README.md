# Kakshya - Classroom Management System

## Overview
Kakshya is a **Classroom Management Application** designed to streamline classroom scheduling and resource allocation within educational institutions. It helps track real-time classroom availability and provides role-based access for Coordinators, Teachers, and Class Representatives (CRs).

## Features
- **Real-time Classroom Vacancy Tracking**: Classrooms are marked using a **color-coded system** (e.g., red for occupied, green for available).
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - **Coordinators**: Upload routines and allocate classrooms based on university blocks.
  - **Class Representatives (CRs)**: Mark classrooms as occupied if needed.
  - **Teachers**: Cancel bookings, updating the status dynamically.
- **Database Integration**: Uses **MySQL** for managing login credentials and schedules.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using **C++ with Qt** for an interactive and responsive experience.
