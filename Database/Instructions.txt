For New Users (First-Time Setup)
🚀 Order of execution:
1️⃣ Createdb.sql → Creates the database
2️⃣ Signuptable.sql → Creates the signup table
3️⃣ Routinetable.sql → Creates the routine table
4️⃣ cr_password.sql  → creates table for authentication of cr

For Existing Users (Resetting the Database)
⚠️ This process deletes all data, so you must re-enter everything (Signup, Upload Routine, etc.).
🚀 Order of execution:
1️⃣ Resetdb.sql → Drops all tables and resets the database
2️⃣ Signuptable.sql → Recreates the signup table
3️⃣ Routinetable.sql → Recreates the routine table
4️⃣ cr_password.sql  → Recreates table for authentication of cr
Note: This second order of execution completely removes all existing data from the database. So you will have to enter(Signup,Upload Routine) data again.


		 since we are doing this on local server this will most likely not be connected in the database so you will manually have to  run the shell command

 Step 1: first open cmd and navigate into kakshya folder and into database folder  (this is for cmd only not for powershell)
 Step 2: Login to MySQL and  Run the following command:
mysql -u root -p
(enter your password most likely it will be root but if u have another pw good luck with that)
and  run exit ; before step 3
Step 3: Execute SQL Files
Run these one by one inside Command Prompt:
mysql -u root -p < Createdb.sql
mysql -u root -p kakshya < Signuptable.sql
mysql -u root -p kakshya < Routinetable.sql
mysql -u root -p kakshya < cr_password.sql
Step 4: Verify the Setup
To check if the tables were created, log into MySQL:
mysql -u root -p
Then run:
USE kakshya;
SHOW TABLES;


🎯 Final Notes
Do NOT use PowerShell (it handles < differently).
If you face errors like "Database already exists", skip Createdb.sql.
If you face errors like "Table already exists", use Resetdb.sql to wipe and restart.
